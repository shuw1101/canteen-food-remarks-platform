# EE312_canteen-food-remarks-platform

This is my group project for course EE312 - Software Engineering. It's an online campus platform for students and university faculties to share their opinions about campus canteen food. Besides, it serves as a window for university canteen to introduce their food and deliver news. The user interface is website.

There are two folders. Folder "demo" contains demonstration video for our website. Folder "project_files" is our project file, created in the pycharm IDE.

The main programming language is Java. We utilize maven as tools and use spring boot to construct the controller, service and dao layers.
Additionaly, mybatis for dataset and thymeleaf to design the http page.
